<h2>Defining the Hacker, Part 2</h2>
<p>Posted <time datetime="2025-03-27">27 March, 2025</time></p>

<p>
I'm back for another part of Defining the Hacker! This part focuses on financially-motivated hackers. I was originally planning to also include
 chaos-/power-motivated hackers, but there's too much interesting stuff on financial hacks for me to fit everything into one part. The next part will
 talk more about the relationships and overlaps between Type 2 and Type 3 hackers :)
</p>

<h4>In The Beginning... There Was The Union Dime Savings Bank</h4>
<p>Financially-motivated hackers are nothing new. I suspect that as long as there have been hackers motivated by benign curiosity,
 there have been those who are looking to profit off of that curiosity. In any case, there are many ways that you can profit
 through hacking. One of the oldest approaches is traditional computer theft -- the fraudulent use of computers to steal money or other financial assets
 that you should not be authorised to access. The earliest example I could find of this was in 1970, when Roswell Steffen,
 the chief teller at the Union Dime Savings Bank, began his three-year embezzlement of US$1.5 million
 (equivalent to around $10.7 million in 2025) using a computer. Given
 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/23/archives/chief-teller-is-accused-of-theft-of-15million-at-a-bank-here-teller.html" target="__blank">
the vague language used by the media to describe his hacking method</a>, such as that he mainly executed the hack by using a computer to 'shuffle
 numbers', it may be impossible for us to determine how he specifically carried out this crime -- Justin Caffier from Mashable
 <a href="https://mashable.com/article/first-cybercriminal-rosnell-steffen-scammed">even posits</a> that Steffen may not have even
 touched a computer during his crime.
</p>

<p>For his part, in a 1974 article entitled
 <a href="http://archive.informationdisplay.org/Portals/InformationDisplay/IssuePDF/V11N05-1974%20SepOctSmall.pdf" target="__blank">
"How I Embezzled $1.5 Million... and Nearly Got Away With It!"</a>, Steffen claimed that he simply skimmed from
 different accounts and moved funds to hide the discrepancies at convenient times, such
 as when quarterly interest payments were due. No programming necessary --
 in fact, he wrote that "programmers should be the bank's least worry" -- just a case of an internal threat who
 knew when to blame suspicious data inconsistencies on a computer bug. Needless to say, financial cyber crimes
 have become significantly more sophisticated today.
</p>
<h4>And God Said, "Let There Be Ransomware."</h4>
<p>
So what do financial hacks look like in 2025? To begin with, their perpetrators likely have
 more programming knowledge than Roswell Steffen ever did. But their method for
 profit also differs considerably -- instead of engaging in fraud or financial
 asset theft, these hackers deal in data theft and extortion. I believe this
 is both because it is now the norm to store all or most of your data digitally/online/in the cloud, and
 because the value and total quantity of data have increased exponentially. Data has become currency,
 thus the potential profit of stealing and reselling data can be many times that of the value of the
 data itself. In fact, withholding stolen data from its original owner and demanding payment
 for its return has become extremely lucrative; this forms the basis of modern-day ransomware.
</p>

<p>
Holding data ransom is a simple concept: you gain access to a target's data, you (optionally) exfiltrate your own copy of the data,
 you encrypt the target's copy so that they can't access anything without a key that you conveniently
 now hold, and you demand money in exchange for the key. Ransomware specifically refers to the malware
 that withholds your target's data; it elegantly circumvents the issues that other methods of financial hacking often encounter. Although
 encryption is not mandatory for a malware to be classified as 'ransomware', it has
 <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/ransomware-data-encryption-increase/649914/" target="__blank">become ransomware's calling card</a>.
</p>

<p>
 Take<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-48120428" target="__blank">
 Daniel Kelley's hack</a> of the British telecom provider TalkTalk in 2015. Solely using SQL injection, Kelley and a group of other hackers
 were able to uncover the financial information of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48351900" target="__blank">nearly 157,000</a>
 TalkTalk customers. But if you're
 Kelley (or any other hacker seeking profit), there are two major obstacles that you need to confront.
 Firstly, according to TalkTalk,
 the method that they used to store their financial data meant that the hack wasn't comprehensive enough to make fraudulent transactions using
 customer data. And secondly, even if he had obtained enough of that data to do so, these customers' banks
 and credit card companies could potentially notice any unusual activity, adding intermediaries and another layer of risk to the
 whole operation. So through more 'traditional computer theft' methods, you simply wouldn't have enough anonymity to profit safely.
</p>

<p>
Kelley and his co-conspirators' solution (in the TalkTalk case
 <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/life-after-cybercrime-one-day-at-a-time/" target="__blank">as well as other hacks</a>) was to blackmail
 company bosses in exchange for Bitcoin, since obviously the unauthorised access or sale of customers' personally identifiable information (PII)
 <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/discordio-halts-operations-data/" target="__blank">can be ruinous for a company</a>.
 Blackmail circumvents the issue of needing complete financial data/interacting with financial intermediaries,
 since you're only accessing the data in order to profit from blackmail payments; therefore, you can also maintain more anonymity compared
 to some traditional computer theft methods.
 What hackers have realised, though, is that the process could be optimised even further. Ransomware has all the benefits of blackmail and more: since
 you cause more disruption by holding data hostage, you are providing an additional incentive for your victim to pay you beyond the fear of reputational
 damages. Not only is the probability of payment likely greater, but your victim might even pay you more quickly if the withheld data is integral
 to continuing business operations.
</p>

<p>
(Note: although <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/the-talktalk-breach-timeline-of-a-hack" target="__blank"> many articles reference
 'ransom payments'</a> being demanded by the TalkTalk hackers, the purpose of payment was to prevent the release of PII to the public -- there
 was no use of actual ransomware in the attack.)
</p>

<p>
Because of the value of PII, larger organisations who store PII (e.g. healthcare organisations) are most likely to be reported on by the media
 when they experience a ransomware attack.
</p>

<h4>Ransomware as a Service</h4>

<p>
In the past few years, even more opportunities have opened up for profiting from ransomware.
RaaS?
</p>

<h4>So What's Next for Financial Hackers?</h4>
<p>
One thing to note is that the average business response to ransomware attacks has changed: according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/
1409448/ransom-payment-rates-us-organizations/" target="__blank">Statista</a>, the share of ransomware attacks which result in ransom payment has
 declined from 85% (Q1 2019) to 32% (Q3 2024), revealing that ransomware attacks are no longer the safe bet that they previously were. After a major
 spike in the second and third quarters of 2023, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1409510/ransom-payment-us-quarterly-amount/"
 target="__blank">the average ransomware payout has also declined</a>. I believe that this is mostly due to a significant government response:
 both the EU and the US have released guidance strongly advising businesses not to pay (in New York you are now even required to notify the government
 of an extortion payment along with extensive justification and diligence proving that such a payment was necessary); at the same time
 that recommendations and legislation have been amended, <a href="">governments have cracked down on ransomware gangs</a> such as
 <a href="">LockBit</a> and <a href="">BlackCat/ALPHV</a>. While this has overall been positive, new collectives offering RaaS (such as RansomHub)
 are gaining prominence. Thus, as long as certain governments (hint: Russia and North Korea) are willing to overlook the criminal hackers within their
 borders, I think we'll continue to see new gangs and collectives popping up to profit from this type of financial hack.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, there are always new methods for profitable hacking. As cryptocurrencies gain more acceptance as a legitimate asset, attackers
 have exploited bugs in smart contracts and crypto exchanges to steal hundreds of millions or even billions of US dollars' worth in crypto.
 Last month, the cryptocurrency exchange ByBit was the victim of a <i>1.5 billion dollar theft</i> from one of its 'more secure' Ether wallets; the
 theft <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/bybit-heist-and-future-us-crypto-regulation" target="__blank">has now been attributed</a> to hackers
 belonging to North Korea's state-sanctioned Lazarus Group. While it would be an understatement to say that the value of Bitcoin and other
 cryptocurrencies has been volatile lately, as long as crypto continues its uphill rise in the public eye, I predict that we will see more and more
 of these enormous crypto heists.

<h4>Notable Actors and Incidents</h4>

<h4>A Brief Note About Daniel Kelley</h4>

<p>
I'd like to end the article by adding that Daniel Kelley is now a reformed white-hat hacker who has done a lot to improve the security of many companies,
 and he has done a lot of great things for cybersecurity awareness since his release from prison in 2021. I have mentioned him as an example not
 because I want to invite further criticism upon him, but because his story is a clear example of how even 'curious hackers' can quickly go down
 the pipeline of becoming 'power-seeking hackers' and subsequently 'profit-seeking hackers'.
