<h2>Now</h2>
<p>Welcome to my 'now' page! :) This update is from 3 May, 2024.</p>

<p>
Let's talk academic updates! I have finally finished my dissertation, which I am going to link here very soon. Now that 
that's all over, I have fallen into a rhythm of revising in a very disciplined and methodical way. Thank goodness, 
because I only had six days between my dissertation deadline and my first exam! In particular, I have spent the last 48 
hours feverishly revising for my Network Security and Security Testing exams, which both seemed to go pretty well for 
me. Funnily enough, my Security Testing exam (which was supposed to start at 13:30) started seven 
minutes late, meaning that I started writing at... 13:37. Coincidence? I think not B)
</p>

<p>
I have recently begun to write poetry again after a long hiatus (think: five years). This is a great method of 
processing things and expressing myself. When I write journal entries, things can get very stream-of-consciousness or 
turn into a venting session. This means that I have journals full of writing 
that is not necessarily useful to me at a later date. I also don't have much interest in writing a daily journal entry 
that is more straightforward. It conjures up ideas of 'Dear Diary, today I ate cereal and did some studying and went to 
the gym,' etc. etc. In contrast, when I write poetry, it is a great way of expressing and processing my thoughts 
because every word is intentional. If it is a good enough poem, when I go back to it later, I am able to re-experience 
these thoughts and review them. I can re-examine my thoughts and evaluate them.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, outside of using poems as a tool, I also like to think of them as art. Not particularly good art, but still! 
It's nice to create. <a href="https://www.strandmagazine.co.uk/single-post/four-steps-for-comprehending" 
target="_blank">Here is a 
link</a> to a poem I wrote in April, titled 'Four Steps for Comprehending'. 
It was published in Strand Magazine, which is a student-run magazine at King's. If I could have stayed at King's 
longer, I would have liked to write articles for them. But you can't do every single thing you want to do at 
university, right? I am generally glad that I chose what I chose. Maybe I could write a poem about that.
</p>

<p>
It feels a little strange writing updates or posts on here, still. I can't exactly control who's reading this, and I 
know where I have and have not yet promoted this website. That means that if anyone is reading this update, it is 
highly likely that you are a stranger or acquaintance coming from my Linkedin or from a Discord server. Then again, 
it is likely that no one is reading this.
</p>

<p>
This aligns with a thought I often have about the Internet. Even if there were one hundred 
strangers reading this right now, I would probably have no way of knowing (unless they all emailed me and shared their 
thoughts on my bad poetry). I wouldn't see their faces or their reactions. But if I showed my website to someone in 
real life, I would see their reaction immediately. They'd have to process and react to my words and my bad poetry in 
real time. That feels far more vulnerable than sharing my thoughts to one hundred online 
strangers. I suspect that this is a common feeling, but have no way of 
confirming it. I don't think this means that I should stop writing on here, 
though. I think it means that I could be less nervous about sharing my inner thoughts and ideas with the people around 
me. This could be a fun concept to write about in the future.

<p>
No news yet from HKU. But I am starting an IT/Cyber internship soon with Nippon Life Benefits, an American subsidiary 
of Nippon Life Insurance Company! I am unbelievably excited about it. I have so much to learn!!! I wish I had more time 
to prepare, but maybe that's part of what all my exam revision is for, haha.
</p>

<p>
I'll try to keep this site somewhat active over the summer. If anyone is reading this, email me! :)
