<h2>What Tabs do I Have Open?</h2>
<p>Posted <time datetime="2024-09-30">30 September, 2024</time></p>

<p>
Hi everyone! While I finalise my 'motivators for hacking' article,
 I thought it would be fun to do a small post about what I'm currently
 reading or researching. This is a new format that I am trying out,
 where I link to a tab that I have open right now and then give a
 description of why I find it interesting. I enjoy reading different people's
 content and listening to their opinions just as much as
 I like writing content and sharing my opinions, so this is the best
 of both worlds :] consider this to be my version of
 <a href="https://pluralistic.net/" target="_blank">Pluralistic</a>.

<h4><a href="https://koblents.com/Ches/Links/Month-Mar-2013/20-Using-Goto-in-Linux-Kernel-Code/" target="_blank">Using Goto in Linux</a></h4>
<p>I was reading Dijkstra's seminal 1968 paper "Go To Statement
 Considered Harmful" -- really interesting!
 I stumbled across this particular link while trying to
 understand how much his ideas hold up today. I don't think that the original
 poster's argument is very compelling, so wish that the anti-goto opinion
 had been more thoughtfully presented. Bearing that in mind, I thought
 Rik van Riel, Robert Love and David Lang explained justified uses of goto
 quite clearly.

<h4><a href="https://danluu.com/teach-debugging/" target="_blank">"Why Don't Schools Teach Debugging?": Random Posts from Dan Luu</a>
</h4>
<p>
I have a few posts from Dan Luu open -- I actually started with
 <a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/" target="_blank">his post</a> on the way people underestimate the time, energy,
 money, etc. it takes for a business product to go from "MVP" to "actually
 commercially viable", and how you couldn't actually just 'build that in
 a weekend'. But this post on debugging especially resonated with me --
 firstly because of its relevancy to my 'engineering reliable software
 systems' (software testing) class, and additionally because of his frank
 and very clear style of writing. This article brings up a lot of memories
 of frustration early on in undergrad, where I felt like I should be able
 to get everything immediately or else I wasn't cut out for computer science.
 It went on for too long, but finally letting go
 of that mindset was a great relief.

Implementing Singular Value Decomposition in Zero-Knowledge Proofs
</a></h4>
<p>
This tab will be open for a bit -- it describes my first deliverable
 for my independent project with
 Dr. Shuai Wang, due in two-ish weeks. I've never encountered
 SVD before, but so far my research into zero-knowledge proof implementations
 has been really interesting! I'm continually referencing and re-reading the
 <a href="https://docs.zkproof.org/reference.pdf" target="_blank">the ZKProof
 Community Reference</a>. I'd love to contribute to the docs someday,
 maybe by producing some of the proposed future figures that the creators want.
