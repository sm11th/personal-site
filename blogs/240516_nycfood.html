<h2>Food in New York City</h2>
<p>Posted <time datetime="2024-05-16">May 16, 2024</time></p>
<p>
I have started my internship! It has a very reasonable 50-50 in-person/remote balance. I am in Midtown Manhattan, which is a fine 1-1.5 hour commute.
</p>
<p>
What I remembered today is that:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>I have free will</li>
    <li>I am going to be in New York 2-3 days a week for the rest of the summer, and</li>
    <li>New York has incredible food!</li>
</ol>
<p>
So instead of doing what I normally do (get to Grand Central around 8:30, kind of hang around for a while, get to the office around 8:50-9:00), I went to Madman Espresso and Bagels for breakfast.

I am still trying to be as busy and productive as possible for my internship! But it definitely helps morale to have a trillion food options for lunch right outside my office. So today I started compiling a list of places that I want to go to around the Grand Central area. Here it is so far:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/L9hbgWM2QFN97Vkg9">$1.50 pizza near Grand Central</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/H6HFr8sta7ok5f5P6">Sushi & Co, Lexington Ave</a></li>
    <li>Ess-A-Bagel</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hey, I never said it was a long list. And I'm trying to be more realistic, because I can only go to places for a quick breakfast before work, during my 30-minute lunch break, or in the brief period 
between 5pm and when my train to CT leaves.
