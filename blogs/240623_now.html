<h2>Now</h2>
<p>Welcome to my 'now' page! :) This update is from 23 June, 2024.</p>


<p>
Hi, it's past time for another update. To describe everything in one sentence: I'm now in the USA where I've been doing an IT/cyber 
internship at Nippon Life Benefits, trying to stay active in programming/IT career/art/Cantonese/gym/family stuff before I move to Hong 
Kong in August and begin my master's programme (and reunite with my girlfriend!).
</p>

<p>
It has been six weeks since I started my internship, and things are going well. My manager gives me a wide variety of tasks and I get to 
interact with other people in IT. I admire them a lot and get a lot of motivation from the idea of reaching their level of knowledge and 
skills. Everyone in IT has also been really friendly, which I appreciate. When there's nothing for me to do (which is very rare), I work 
on my programming projects and brainstorm article ideas. I am also working on a few high-level AI tasks for the underwriting and IT 
departments. I like working in New York, I like being 50/50 in-person/remote, I like my company, and I like being involved in IT things 
all the time.
</p>

<p>
This summer, I have a list of twelve-ish goals I'd like to achieve and six main areas/fields that I want to work on. Those six areas are: 
server-side programming, IT career stuff, Cantonese, creative expression, physical/mental wellbeing, and cultivating my relationships 
with friends and family. I try to spend time on at least three areas every day. To call back to my article about goal-setting and 
<i>Atomic Habits</i> by James Clear, it's like addressing these areas is a way of working on my systems, and my goals are benchmarks to 
see how effective/sufficient my systems are. Here's a visual of my track record for each area:

<p>
You can tell that I'm doing alright, but need to step it up with programming and Cantonese -- oops. I think I should start to aim for 
four areas a day since it feels like I could do more. I'm glad to be prioritising family time, though, especially with the upcoming move.
</p>

<h4>Server-Side Programming and IT Stuff</h4>
<p>
I'm currently working on a couple things. The mini project is that I am connecting this site to a database filled with my own restaurant 
rankings so visitors can see my top restaurant recommendations. It's like the app Beli, except that I'm the only one who updates the 
database. I have other programming projects in the works but won't share them for now. Outside of work hours, I self-teach about 
protocols/policies/etc that are useful for my job and potential career in security. I am thinking of doing a 'ten days of Portswigger' 
series on here where I solve different Web Academy labs. I also keep a brag sheet with the things I've done at my job so I can make sure 
that I am progressing and helping my company concretely (and so I can put my accomplishments on my CV later).
</p>
<p>
Right now, I am unsure where my career will go. I have been planning to go into computer networking / network security for the past 
two years, but now I wonder if I would prefer going into backend development. Since I was sixteen, which is when I took my first 
programming class, I have felt anxious about 'not being a real programmer'. It's a frustrating and irrational block. Other IT/security 
skills come a lot easier to me, and I enjoy security so much -- but since I took that first class, programming has been my holy grail. 
I want to improve, but I will continue to stagnate until I stop worrying about being stupid. This makes it difficult for me to evaluate 
which area I actually prefer. It's not too stressful -- I'm trying hard to figure things out and gain more clarity.
</p>

<h4>Cantonese and Art</h4>
<p>
In other news, I recently started Cantonese lessons, which will run until the beginning of August. I haven't tried to learn a new 
language since I started learning German in eighth grade (eight years ago!) so this really takes me back. There's something so fun and 
also funny about taking a language class for beginners because we're all struggling together. I probably sound hilarious when I try to 
speak, but it doesn't bother me. I take group lessons on Zoom from Hills Learning in NYC, and can definitely recommend them.
</p>

<p>
My current painting project is a rose bouquet still life for my girlfriend (belated Valentine's Day gift), and I am writing poetry when I 
can. I might put some more poetry and art on a dedicated page here, if I decide it's good enough. I have been reading a lot of books and 
crossing movies off of my to-watch list. I intend to start writing book and film reviews for this site once I've gotten more consistent 
with my posting.
</p>

<h4>Wellbeing and Quality Time</h4>
<p>
Finally, for mental/physical wellbeing, I'm still going to the gym and I try to walk/hike a lot. I have quantitative bench/curl/leg press 
goals that I would like to reach by the end of 
the summer, but because it's so hectic with visits, travel, work, graduation, <i>and</i> my move to HK, I will be happy as long as I 
noticeably progress and maintain some gym consistency.
</p>

<p>
When I'm not working on my silly amount of goals, I am hanging out. Now that the stress of university is briefly over, I am reading, 
watching movies and the WNBA, and exploring NYC. I feel very different from how I was during my last update -- I have a lot more energy 
and 
time for hobbies. I hope that I can maintain most of these healthier habits when I start my master's. Still no word from HKU on if I've 
gotten into their programme, but it is what it is and HKUST is a great school. It's so insane that I'm going to Hong Kong at all!
