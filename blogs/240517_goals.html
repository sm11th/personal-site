<h2>How should we design our goals?</h2>
<p>Posted <time datetime="2024-05-17">17 May, 2024</time></p>
<p>
When I post this blog update, it will be my third article of the "summer" (post-King's, pre-Hong Kong 
university period). My goal was to post five articles this summer, and so far I'm ahead of that!
</p>
<p>
For the past three years, I have been very conscious of my mindset when I create goals. The first reason for 
that is because I have struggled a lot in the past with perfectionist tendencies and prioritising 
achievement over my health. It makes me feel like I have to be careful when I start making new goals, like 
I'm going to fall off the wagon or something :-) The second reason is that three years ago, I read <a 
href="https://jamesclear.com/" target="__blank">"Atomic 
Habits" by James Clear</a>.
</p>
<p>
I won't try to summarise the whole book, since I haven't read it for a while. But I took a lot of notes when 
I read it, and there were a few really great things that I took away from it:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>It is important to constantly have (realistic) things to strive for in your life.</li>
  <li>The likelihood of you achieving your goals is hugely dependent on how you design your goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I don't have much to say about the first point because things just vary a lot person to person. Still, when 
I started making more specific, actionable, granular goals for myself, my satisfaction with my life and myself 
went way up. I think it was great for the people around me, as well.
</p>
<p>
For the second point, James gives a lot of great advice about designing goals. Firstly, things that you 
strive for should be achievable and sustainable. Some unrealistic goals that people often strive for are
going to the gym six times a week when they normally never exercise, or going on extreme short-term diets 
that they can't maintain. Maybe they meet these targets for two weeks, but mostly, people end up 
giving up pretty fast and being really frustrated with themselves because of it. It's a shame 
because I think that making goals is something we should all be proud of ourselves for doing, but it 
can lead us to being deeply dissatisfied with ourselves. Instead, James argues, we should aim to "prioritise 
systems over goals". </p>
<p>
Systems are the actions and methodologies we use when we strive to achieve goals. For instance, your goal 
might be to get a top grade on your Cryptography exam, but your system is your method of revising, 
how often you revise, and the way you ask for help when you don't understand something. James points out 
that people who succeed and people who fail often have the same goal. The difference is in the way that they 
cultivate their systems.</p>
<p>
For me, this often means giving up on a concrete goal ("get top grades! Bench this much weight!") and 
focusing on consistency. My goals end up sounding more like: "go to the gym 3-4 times a week", or "go to 
total failure on every set today". I trust that by cultivating the right system, I will eventually end up 
benching a nice high weight anyways, and it will happen in a more healthy way.
</p>
<p>
This brings me to another point, though. Even though I might explicitly have the same goal as someone else 
("go to the gym x times per week"), I also try to be realistic and sustainable about how I achieve that. I 
didn't start off by expecting myself to immediately to the gym four times a week. The gym was so scary to me 
that my first 
big achievement there was showing up and doing one exercise! After that exercise, I got so anxious that I 
hid in one of the bathroom stalls and tried to calm myself down for about ten minutes, and then I left. So 
then my next mini-goal was to show up the next day and do three exercises. I built my way up to a full 
workout, and I built that up to multiple workouts a week.
</p>
<p>
I was probably more anxious than most people when I first started at the gym. But my 
suspicion is that there are many people out there who set their expectations to immediately going four 
times a week, and then they hate themselves for not being able to do that, and then these negative emotions 
drive them away from going at all. If I didn't think about systems and how to build them sustainably, who 
knows? I probably would have felt the same way.
</p>
<p>
I'll end this with a few disclaimers. The first is that I think everyone is different, and going so into 
detail with your goals that you map out yearly, seasonal and weekly goals is never a one-size-fits-all 
approach. I will probably come back to this in a few years and realise that I have completely changed 
the way I try to achieve things, especially as I gain more responsibilities in my life. I also don't judge 
people for making goals in a certain way, because I think that it is really brave to try to achieve 
anything in the first place. The reason why I wrote this article is because seeing the way other people designed
 their goals -- James Clear, my family, my girlfriend, or anyone else
 -- was incredibly helpful for me figuring out my own approach. Whether you like 
it or you hate it, I hope that reading about my approach to making goals has provided some insight to you on 
the way that you want to approach yours. :-)
