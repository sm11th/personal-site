<p>Today is <time datetime="2025-01-15">15 January, 2025.</time></p>

<p>
It's been a few months! In short, I got very busy with university and
 job applications, then suddenly it was finals season, and then as soon
 as that was all over, I flew to the US to visit my family and celebrate
 Christmas. Since then I've been recovering from a nasty combination
 of flu and pneumonia (both at once!!!) -- and spending some time exploring
 NYC and my parents' town with my girlfriend. It's hard to comprehend
 how fast the time has gone, but on the 19th I'll be flying back to HK
 for a job interview.
</p>

<p>
 In the midst of all this, I am trying my best to reflect on the past year
 and concentrate on my priorities for 2025. January is one of my favourite
 months -- to me, it feels especially full of potential and excitement.
 I have spent many Januaries evaluating how well I achieved my resolutions
 from the past year, and crafting new and better resolutions for the upcoming
 one. This year, though I still have plenty of goals and dreams, I am
 thinking of approaching them differently.
</p>

<p>
I believe that by creating relatively many resolutions every year,
 I confused quantity with comprehensiveness. When evaluating
 each year solely based on how well I achieved my resolutions (or planning
 the whole year around my resolutions), I made the implicit and reductive
 assumption that my health, happiness, relationships and success -- i.e. my
 whole life -- could be quantified by just 15-20 resolutions. Campbell's
 Law seems appropriate: "The more any quantitative social indicator
 is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption
 pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the
 social processes it is intended to monitor." Okay, there were no corruption
 pressures involved in this, but the rest is very accurate.
</p>

<p>
 This year will be a test for me to see if having fewer (or maybe even zero)
 written resolutions will cause my health, happiness, relationships and success
 to actually improve. It might serve me better to look at my life holistically
 instead of trying to come up with a holistic-seeming, but inherently
 limiting, set of resolutions. Maybe I should trust that I have the drive,
 ambition, and self-awareness to create a life that is best for me. And if
 that somehow doesn't work, who said you can't come up with mid-year
 resolutions? Much to think about :)
</p>

<p>
In other news, I'm excited to write more blog posts this year! I'm sure 2025
 will be very eventful and I hope to document and explore all of it. Here's
 a start:
