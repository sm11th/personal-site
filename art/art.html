<h2>My Art</h2>
<p>Last updated <time datetime="2024-08-27">27 August, 2024</time></p>
<p>
Hello everyone, and welcome to my art page! I don't love to share everything I work on, but maybe this can serve 
as a 'mini-portfolio' area. Beyond the acrylic works and poetry below, I have recently begun my woodworking 
journey -- I'd like to add those here soon.
</p>
<p>
My current works-in-progress:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A small woodblock stamp with a handle customised for a left-handed grip (basswood)</li>
<li>A still life of a bouquet of roses (gift for my girlfriend, acrylic on canvas)</li>
</ul>
<p>
