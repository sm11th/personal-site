<h2>Defining the Hacker</h2>
<p>Posted <time datetime="2024-10-17">17 October, 2024</time></p>

<p>
After thoroughly enjoying the fifteenth Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) conference this
 past July, I have decided that it’s time for the term ‘hacker’ to be clarified. Because
 of the broad range of those who call themselves hackers, as well as the common perception
 of hackers based on the actions of a few, I want to explore the
 etymology of the word ‘hacker’ and the four main motivators for those who call themselves
 hackers.
</p>

<p>
This project initially started off as just one article, but the more I delved into each type
 of hacker, the more information I found necessary to include.
 This is the first part of three, wherein we
 will discuss the history and etymology of the word ‘hacker’ and explore
 examples of hackers motivated by political ideology. The next part compares hackers
 who are motivated by financial gain and hackers who are motivated by a desire for
 chaos or power, and delves into the evolution (or disappearance) of the "script kiddie".
 The final part discusses hackers motivated by a desire for knowledge or safety,
 my experiences at this year's Hackers on Planet Earth conference, and my
 own stance towards hacking.
</p>

<h4>Public Perception: The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same</h4>

<p>
If you stopped a person on the street and asked them to define the word
 'hacker', what do you think they would say? Given what's on the news these days,
 it is likely they would describe someone who breaks into company or government
 systems in order to sabotage them or gain access to confidential data. If that person pays
 a little more attention to geopolitical conflicts or data breaches, you might hear words
 like “election interference”, “extortion” and “ransomware”, or company names like
 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/change-healthcare-cyberattack-unitedhealth-senate-9e2fff70ce4f93566043210bdd347a1f" target="__blank">Change Healthcare</a>
 and
 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b" target="__blank">AT&T</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you asked the same question twenty years ago, you might hear less about hackers who
 hacked for their governments or for profit, but that doesn’t mean that the perception
 of hacking was any more positive. Instead, the American media
 popularised the image of hackers
 as <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/Pre_96/February95/89.txt.html" target="__blank">young men who worked alone</a>
 or 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151016141033/https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/03/magazine/hack-counterhack.html?scp=2&sq=l0pht%20heavy&st=cse" target="__blank">
 with their young male friends</a> to deface websites, bring
 down companies’ systems, steal intellectual property, and generally cause mayhem. The
 stereotypical hacker’s motivators and actions may have changed, but his reputation has
 remained just as nefarious.
</p>

<h4>The Etymology Of Hacking, And Its Modern-Day Motivators</h4>

<p>
It’s a shame that the word ‘hacker’ now has this connotation, because the original
 definition of the word actually had nothing to do with malicious activity. The first
 people who called themselves ‘hackers’ were curious, problem-solving people who were
 interested in computers. Generally,
 these hackers simply wanted to understand and improve systems, not exploit them
 for personal gain or to cause widespread negative effects -- and importantly,
 they often denounced those who attempted to sabotage or reverse-engineer systems for gain,
 <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/a-short-history-of-hack" target="__blank">dubbing them ‘crackers’</a>
. Today, many who are called hackers actually fall under the
 original definition for ‘crackers’ (also known as ‘phreakers’, if they attempt to
 reverse-engineer telephone systems, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/02/the-definitive-story-of-steve-wozniak-steve-jobs-and-phone-phreaking/273331/" target="__blank">
as Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak used to do as teenagers</a>).
</p>

<p>
Those who call themselves hackers in the original sense, including many ardent 2600
 Magazine readers and HOPE attendees, still regularly refer to the hacker/cracker
 dichotomy and have spent decades trying to change the connotation of the word in the
 public eye. Personally, I think changing the minds and language of so many
 people is fruitless at this point – the headlines are basically the only way most
 even see the word ‘hacker’ – but we shouldn’t let the original meaning die out, either.
 This is the fundamental reason for why I now want to explore my
 typology for the four main schools of hackers.
 Whether others would call them hackers, crackers, or simply IT professionals is
 unimportant to me in this context; I specifically want to explore the four most common
 motivators of <i>those who call themselves hackers</i>. Let us now
 explore hackers who are motivated by political ideology.
</p>

<h4>Type 1: Political Ideology</h4>
<p>
From 2022 to 2023, cyberattacks motivated by “religion, politics and the quest for
 fame” increased <a href="https://www.itbrew.com/stories/2023/09/12/new-report-details-rise-in-hacktivism-motivations-for-attacks" target="__blank">
from 1% to 35% of all cyberattacks.</a>
 Many have heard of 'hacktivists'
 or 'nation-state-affiliated hackers'-- in this section, we discuss
 what a politically-motivated hacker looks like.
 The most obvious examples of this
 type of hacker are those employed by or affiliated with the governments
 of countries such as the United States, North Korea, Israel, China, and Russia – although
 the list of all countries which utilise hacking or cyber assaults for the stated purpose
 of ‘national security’ would be far too long to list here.
</p>
<p>
In the United States,
 pro-government ‘hackers’ are likely to be individuals employed full-time
 by the NSA or military to engage in ‘proactive cyber defence’, which includes hacking
 individuals and organisations (see well-known exploits or weapons such as
 <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/" target="__blank">Stuxnet</a> and
 <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/eternalblue-nsa-developed-exploit-just-wont-die/" target="__blank">EternalBlue</a>
, but also allegedly
 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-israel-developed-computer-virus-to-slow-iranian-nuclear-efforts-officials-say/2012/06/19/gJQA6xBPoV_story.html" target="__blank">the Stuxnet descendant</a>
 <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1150433/lobban-nsa-visit-precis.pdf#page=3" target="__blank">Flame</a>
 and
 <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/regin-malware-unmasked-as-nsa-tool-after-spiegel-publishes-source-code-a-1015255.html" target="__blank">
Regin</a>).
 In other countries such as Russia, it appears
 relatively more common for existing hacker collectives (such as
 <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/who-is-fancy-bear/" target="__blank">Fancy Bear</a>,
 <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/noname05716-the-pro-russian-hacktivist-group-targeting-nato/" target="__blank">Noname057(16)</a>,
 <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-attacks-on-australian-universities/" target="__blank">Killnet</a>,
 and
 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russia-hacking-xaknet-killnet/" target="__blank">Xaknet</a>) to be recruited or simply not persecuted by the
 government in exchange for executing attacks on enemies of the Kremlin
 (see: the
 <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/cyber-operations-during-russo-ukrainian-war#h2-russian-cyber-operations" target="__blank">cyberattacks</a>
 that occurred on Ukrainian infrastructure and essential websites immediately prior to
 the Russian invasion of Kiev in 2022). We could
 certainly debate whether all nation-state-affiliated hackers act
 out of sheer patriotism or if they are motivated by something else (are they
 being pressured by their government? Are they just doing it for a paycheck?), but at
 the end of the day, the intended result of their hacking is that the government with
 whom they collaborate gets their aims furthered.
</p>
<p>
Also noteworthy are non-government-affiliated hacktivism groups such as Anonymous
 and WikiLeaks/DDoSecrets. Anonymous is a loosely-organised anarchist hacker collective
 which has regularly engaged in politically-motivated cyberattacks against a
 variety of targets since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050312/http://www.
citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543" target="__blank">at least 2008</a>. In my opinion,
 the sheer size and decentralised structure of Anonymous allows for those
 who simply want chaos to be easily lumped in
 with those who are genuine anarchists and hacktivists. Past targets include
 those who Anonymous has perceived to be “pro-censorship” (such as the
 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us-politics/exclusive-fbi-warns-of-us-government-breaches-by-anonymous-hackers-idUSBRE9AE17D/" target="__blank">
American</a>,
 <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2022/11/02/2003788129" target="__blank">Chinese</a>,
 <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/28/how-is-anonymous-attacking-russia-the-top-six-ways-ranked-.html" target="__blank">Russian, Belarusian,</a>
 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/anonymous-says-hacks-tunisia-prime-ministers-emails-idUSBRE8370FA/" target="__blank">Tunisian</a>,
 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/31/anonymous-hackers-zimbabwe-wikileaks" target="__blank">Zimbabwean</a>,
 and
 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/world/middleeast/pro-palestinian-hackers-attack-israeli-sites.html" target="__blank">Israeli</a>
 governments, and
 <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1607579/anonymous-hacker-group-declares-cyber-war-hong-kong" target="__blank">various
 government sites and companies in Hong Kong</a>), “anti-Wikileaks” (
<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2010/12/09/technology/amazon_wikileaks_attack/index.htm" target="__blank">Amazon, Mastercard, and Paypal</a>),
 and controversial religious groups (
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-12523184" target="__blank">Westboro Baptist Church</a>,
 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/02/07/18764756/anonymous-wages-attack-on-scientologists" target="__blank">the Church of Scientology</a>).
 The extreme pro-anonymity, pro-anarchy and
 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelpeck/2013/04/08/why-did-anonymous-have-to-attack-israel-on-holocaust-memorial-day/" target="__blank">
antisemitism</a>
 that Anonymous
 has historically expressed are likely due in part to its origins as a trolling group on
 4Chan.
</p>
<p>
WikiLeaks and DDoSecrets differ strongly from traditional hacktivist groups in that
 they don’t engage in attacks that bring down websites or affect availability-- instead,
 they publish previously secret data and act as whistleblowers. WikiLeaks is most
 famous (or infamous) for their leaking of
 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/06/25/julian-assange-wikileaks-baghdad-helicopter-video/" target="__blank">controversial US military
 logs and footage</a>
 provided to them by then-US Army soldier Chelsea Manning, and later, their
 <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/" target="__blank">public archive</a>
 of Hillary Clinton's private email server during her 2016 US presidential campaign.
 DDoSecrets, while slightly less-known, is the world's <a href"https://ddosecrets.com/about" target="__blank">
"largest public library of previously-secret information"</a>. It has published
 historic leaks of confidential American police force data in 2020 (BlueLeaks),
 a huge amount of data about the Russian military since the start of the war in Ukraine,
 and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics
/trump-riot-videos-parler-impeachment-b1801019.html" target="__blank">leaked Parler data</a>
 which was used as evidence during the second impeachment of Donald Trump.
</p>
<p>
Most recently, pro-Palestinian hacktivist group BlackMeta has claimed responsibility
 for the cyberattacks on the nonprofit Internet Archive, 
<a href="https://x.com/Sn_darkmeta/status/1845502888480579860" target="__blank">alleging</a>
 that they did so in order to “[highlight] the plight of innocent Palestinian people”
 and that targeting the digital library “serves to underscore the importance of
 [Palestinians'] story and experiences”. They have also claimed involvement in DDoS attacks
 on multiple Israeli banks and Big Tech companies, but all of these allegations have yet
 to be confirmed. It is currently theorised that
 <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/internet-archive-hacked-data-breach-impacts-31-million-users/" target="__blank">multiple
 actors were at play</a>
 during the days-long cyber assault on the Internet Archive.

<p>
Thank you for reading the first instalment of this series! I look forward to publishing
 the next part, which will discuss financially-motivated hackers, hackers motivated by
 a desire for chaos or power, and how ransomware has fundamentally changed the way
 that both operate.
</p>

<p>
Throughout this series, I would also like to make it clear that I do not support
 any illegal or unethical hacking activities or groups. If you note any claims
 that are factually incorrect, don't hesitate to let
 me know by email, and I will correct them as soon as possible. Thanks!
