<p>Today is <time datetime="2025-04-26">26 April, 2025.</time></p>

<p>
I am finishing up my final semester at HKUST
 and will start my grad role once I graduate this summer. I have enjoyed
 UST a lot -- I think it's a great school --  but I've gotten everything
 that I wanted from the university experience and now I'm ready to start a new
 chapter. My grad role is based in Hong Kong and is centred around IT and
 cybersecurity. Not sure how much dev work I'll be doing, so maybe I should
 change my top-level domain :)

<p>
I'll be in the US this summer from June 20th to July 20th,
 so feel free to reach out if you'll be in Connecticut or New York around that
 time.
