<h2>Union SQLi -- A PortSwigger Exercise</h2>
<p>Posted <time datetime="2024-05-11">11 May, 2024</time></p>
<p>
Hello, and welcome to my first actual writeup on here!
</p>
<p>
Today I will be doing a quick walkthrough through <a 
href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database/lab-querying-database-version-oracle" target="_blank">a 
PortSwigger Web Security Academy exercise</a>. This is a 
Practitioner-level lab, with the objective of successfully executing a 
UNION SQLi attack that will display the type and version of this site's 
database.
</p>
<p>
Some context: the UNION operator is generally used in SQL to return 
similar results from 
two different areas of a database, such as from two different tables. 
Executing a statement like 'SELECT a,b FROM users UNION SELECT c,d FROM 
accounts' will return the values of columns a and b for all users, along 
with the values of columns c and d for all accounts. The column datatypes 
for each SELECT statement must be similar (i.e., a should be similar to c 
and b should be similar to d), and each statement must select the same 
number of columns.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, to successfully execute a UNION SQLi attack, 
we have to inject a few different statements first in order to determine 
the number and types of columns in the original, benign query. After that, 
we can use the UNION operator to execute additional statements. I like 
UNION SQLi because it requires a little more sleuthing than a simple 
tautology-based SQL injection.
</p>
<p>
In this lab, we are aiming to execute the SQL statement 'SELECT banner 
FROM v$version'. We know we need to execute <a 
href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet" target="_blank">this 
statement</a> because the lab instructions hinted that this is an Oracle 
database. Opportunities for user input are quite limited. The only way to 
modify the page is to refine the types of products shown by category. You 
can observe and modify your requests using Burp (community edition is 
sufficient). Here is what a regular HTTP request looks like when you 
refine products by the category 'Accessories':
</p>
<center><img src="images/240511_normal_request.png" alt="'Accessories'" width="400" height="402"></center>
<p>
Based on the description of the lab, and the lack of viable user input 
elsewhere, we know that this must be the source of input for SQL 
statements. Maybe the initial statement that gets executed is something 
like 'SELECT * FROM products WHERE category='Accessories'', but we can't be 
certain at this point.
</p>
<p>
The next step for us is to figure out the number and type of columns being 
executed by the original statement. Here is one payload that allows us to 
do this:
</p>
<center><img src="images/240511_order_request.png" alt="'+ORDER+BY+1--" width="400" height="426"></center>
<p>
As stated in <a 
href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks" target="_blank">this 
helpful article</a>, you can send repeated requests with this particular 
payload. This orders results by different columns, specifying which column 
to order by with its index. Starting with ' ORDER BY 1--, we can increment 
our column index until there is an error, which signifies an index out of 
bounds and means that we have exceeded the amount of columns in the 
original query. In this case, we got an error with the payload ' ORDER BY 
3--, so there are only two columns.
</p>
<p>
After that, we can inject this payload:
</p>
<center><img src="images/240511_union_request.png" alt="'+UNION+SELECT+'a',NULL+FROM+v$version--" width="402" height="400"></center>
<p>
Note that because this is Oracle, our SELECT statements always have to 
have a FROM operator.
</p>
<p>
Since it executed successfully, we now know that the first column is at 
least similar to some type of string type. This is good news for us 
because our desired statement ('SELECT banner FROM v$version') selects a 
column of datatype VARCHAR2(80). So we now know that the original 
statement selects two columns, and the first column is some kind of 
varchar/string type situation. How do we modify our desired statement to 
fit these constraints?
</p>
<p>
The answer is simple: we just have to select an additional NULL column 
from v$version. Therefore our final injected payload is:
</p>
<p>
' UNION SELECT banner, NULL FROM v$version
</p>
<p>
Great news! We have gotten the site to display its database information, 
which could help us if we wanted to execute additional malicious 
statements. There are a few key takeaways from this lab:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>UNION SQLi is a great way to glean additional information from 
a database, and practicing it is a fun way of trying to 'reverse 
engineer' the server side code of a website.</li>
  <li>SQLi doesn't just occur when you give a user an unsanitised 
user/password form. The issue here is that a developer assumed that 
users would only use the site as intended, clicking on the different 
categories that were available on the site. You should always assume 
that any possible user input is going to be exploited and leveraged 
by an attacker, and that client-side controls will not stop them.</li> 
</ul> 
<p> Thanks for reading! For my next writeup, I am thinking about discussing Web LLM (large language model) 
attacks, discussing security in the context of this extremely 
trendy, controversial and misunderstood field.
