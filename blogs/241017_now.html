I am more than halfway through the first term of my IT master's programme at HKUST, and
 I am really enjoying it. Every single class has elements that I enjoy, which makes me
 feel pretty lucky. Between that and all of the job applications that
 I'm sending out, my days are full! So far I'm most enjoying my independent
 project -- it's a great challenge learning Rust, linear algebra and zero-knowledge
 proof systems at the same time -- and my Principles of Cybersecurity class is also a
 highlight.

I've been intending to publish this article about a classification system/motivational
 typology I've developed for hackers, detailing characteristics and examples of each
 type, but it's become so long that I'm just going to turn it into a series and publish
 it in parts. Today I will publish my first part, which talks about the etymology and
 history of the word 'hacker', and the first type in my
 system (hackers motivated by political ideology). I'm excited to get this out, and
 then I'll work on some more PortSwigger web tutorials (still have that LLM attacks
 article drafted from ages ago).
