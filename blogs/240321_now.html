<h2>Now</h2>
<p>Welcome to my 'now' page! :) This update is from 21 March, 2024.</p>
<p>I am currently doing a lot of frenzied work on my dissertation -- there are only 23 days to go! I am about 7k words into the final report... but my experiments aren't 
where I currently want them to be, so I'm doing a lot of last-minute programming and model retraining at the moment. Wish me luck :)</p>
<p>I am also in the process of finding an internship in IT/Cybersecurity this summer. I'm enthusiastic about gaining experience in any area of IT, so whatever happens, 
I'll learn a lot!</p>
<p>Master's Update: I'm finishing my BSc in Computer Science at King's College London soon and will be relocating to Hong Kong for a Master's in IT/cyber. Currently I've 
committed to HKUST for an MSci in IT, but am still waiting to hear back from HKU as well.</p>
<p>Outside of my degree, I'm achieving some great things as well! After years of being too nervous to go to the gym, I have finally gotten a membership at one near my 
flat. It has branches in a lot of other countries too, which is great during times like now when I'm not in London. I was doing some home workouts with these 5 kg 
dumbbells I had, but it wasn't as enjoyable or efficient for achieving results as going to an actual gym. So far I've been going for a month and a half.</p> 
<p>Obviously gaining strength and muscle has been a significant motivator for going, but I've noticed that without trying, it's also been great for my mental health. I am the 
type of person to think about things a lot rather than living in the moment-- like if I'm struggling with a particular part of my coursework or dissertation, I think a 
lot about how to fix things instead of being present in the moment. But when I'm at the gym, it's really just me intensely focusing on whatever I'm trying to do at that 
moment. It's very meditative.</p>
<p>Currently reading Kevin Mitnick's 'The Art Of Intrusion' -- so far it's pretty interesting. Maybe I should start taking notes on the books I read, like Derek Sivers does on his website. I also want to look into self-hosting and increasing my tech independence. But these 
are all projects for when my dissertation is finished (deadline 12 April) and my exams are over (2-7 May)! It's going to be a very busy 6-7 weeks, but after that I can finally relax a little. And hopefully visit my cool SWE sister who 
lives in San Francisco :)</p>
