<h2>What Tabs do I Have Open? Part 2!</h2>
<p>Posted <time datetime="2025-03-19">19 March, 2025</time></p>

<p>
Hello, it's been a bit -- after much drafting I have come to the conclusion that my Defining the Hacker series needs four parts instead of three, so that's caused an unfortunate delay
 (it's self-imposed, I just like discussing ransomware too much). To get myself back in a routine of posting on here, I thought I'd do another episode of 'What Tabs do I Have Open?'
</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.cairo-lang.org/tutorial/getting-started-with-cairo/">A tutorial for Cairo, a Rust-like zero knowledge proof programming language</a></h4>
<p>
As with last term, I'm working with Dr Shuai Wang and his PhD students on some cool zero-knowledge proof stuff (mostly using Rust and the Halo2 crate). This term I'm working
 with one of his PhD students on a transpiler between Python/Python-ish programs and Halo2. Very cool stuff!! The same PhD student is trying to evaluate the ease of writing
 these Pythonish (Pythonic?) ZK proof programs in comparison with existing ZK proof languages, so I'm participating in a user study where I compare the difficulty of writing proofs in
 his framework and in Cairo, a language which I had never heard of before. I'm really excited about it. As I mess around with Cairo I'm also reading
 <a href="https://book.cairo-lang.org/">the Cairo Book</a> and <a href="https://cairo-by-example.com/">looking at example programs</a>.

<h4><a href="https://www.oliveriliffe.net/">Other</a> <a href="https://danluu.com/">People's</a> <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/">Blogs</a></h4>
<p>
Have I uploaded a real article since October? No! But I have been reading a lot of blog posts from other people on the Internet about various topics.
<a href="https://www.oliveriliffe.net/">Oli</a>'s another former King's student and I think
 he has some fun content about his current research projects at Imperial. <a href="https://danluu.com">Dan Luu</a> has a great blog sharing his thoughts on writing, tech companies and culture, and
 other stuff. I find he has a good eye for identifying areas in life where people aren't logical (even things like baseball scouting). I like learning more about big tech and Silicon
 Valley from him too. Finally, I haven't read much from <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/">Ned Batchelder</a>, but he seems like a cool guy, and he's the guy who wrote coverage.py
 so I like reading his updates about that.

<h4><a href="https://www.hackingchinese.com/blog/">Hacking Chinese</a></h4>
<p>
Not one of my usual sites for learning about hacking! This is a really good website on learning Mandarin. Eventually I want to take real lessons, but right now I'm self-studying Mandarin
 (aka doing Duolingo and trying to find characters that are similar on the Cantonese signs I see around Hong Kong). I like lists, I like challenges, I like looking at what other people find difficult
 when I'm trying to learn a new language. I'd recommend checking out this site if you're a beginner at Mandarin like I am.

<h4><a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/an-orchestrated-recession-trumps">Kyla Scanlon's thoughts on tariffs and AI</a></h4>
<p>
We're early on into a new US administration and the restructuring of the global order has been even more acute than in Trump's first term. The whole thing has not only
 brought added uncertainty into my personal life (my family, the stability of my country of origin, my status as an expat in Hong Kong), but it's also affected my planned investment
 strategy. I wouldn't consider myself a risky investor and it's concerning to view previously 'safe' investments as more volatile, so I've been reading more on the whole tariffs
 situation, strategy and other stuff like that. I'd never heard of Kyla Scanlon before, but I thought this article was well written, so I've signed up to her Substack. I will say
 though, I am still completely unsold on the idea that we're close to AGI (artificial general intelligence) and it's strange for companies and countries to be restructuring
 all of their operations in anticipation of it. Like, the best commercial product for 'replacing' an office worker right now is Microsoft Copilot and it's useless for more than the simplest tasks,
 not to mention the weirdness of any CEO actually wanting to 'replace employees with AI'.
