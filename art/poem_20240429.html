<h2>Portrait in Bad Times</h2>
<p>Drafted <time datetime="2024-04-29">29 April, 2024</time></p>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">
Here is my hug that I give to you today,
A soft, trembling, forced thing.
I hold you like an unwanted petâ€“
I cradle you like an eggshell that I am taking to the bin.

At night, I always think of you.
I dream that you are nestled in my arms like a small sun.
We orbit each other in the dark, unmarred.

When I wake, your small form is sprawled in a corner.
You stir with me.
You reach for me like a baby, and here I am, repulsed,
Offering you my half-embrace
In exchange for another day of living.
